<p>Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage or embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions. Shiny combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. Shiny apps are easy to write. No web development skills are required. Please see my first shiny app.</p>
